Networking, infrastructure,systems administration, software architecture, back-end software development, API design, front-end app design.

II. What is serverless 

- Serverless <- Platform as a Service (PaaS) <- Cloud <- Virtual private servers <-Colocation <- NeXT Computer

-	NeXT Computer (Simple websites, the bedroom/ physical problem)

-	Co-location (Data center (1997 - 2000), wasting money problem)

- Virtualization (Virtual hosts, virtual private servers, containerization)

- Cloud (Automation & containers, Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration)

-	Platform as a Service (PaaS): A variation on the cloud.

-	Serverless is the logical next step after PaaS (Metered pricing).
